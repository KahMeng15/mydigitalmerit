# Upload Merits - Merit Type Dropdown Fix

## Issue
The merit type dropdown selection was not being saved when the page was refreshed. Users had to re-select the merit type every time they refreshed the page during the upload process.

## Root Cause
Two issues were identified:

1. **Missing from Save Data**: The `meritType` field was not included in the `formData` object that gets saved to localStorage in the `saveProgressToStorage()` function.

2. **Timing Issue**: Even if the value was saved, it wasn't being restored properly because the dropdown options need to be populated first (which happens when an event is selected), and then the saved value needs to be set.

## Solution

### 1. Added `meritType` to Saved Form Data
Updated the `saveProgressToStorage()` function to include `meritType` in the formData:

```javascript
formData: {
    eventSelect: getFormValue('eventSelect'),
    childActivitySelect: getFormValue('childActivitySelect'),
    meritType: getFormValue('meritType'),  // ← ADDED
    meritSource: getFormValue('meritSource'),
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Fixed Restoration Timing
Updated the `restoreFormData()` function to restore the merit type selection AFTER the dropdown options have been populated:

```javascript
// Restore meritType after a delay to ensure options are populated
if (formData.meritType) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const meritTypeSelect = document.getElementById('meritType');
        if (meritTypeSelect) {
            meritTypeSelect.value = formData.meritType;
            // Trigger the change handler to update UI
            handleMeritTypeChange();
        }
    }, 600);
}
```

## How It Works

### Save Process:
1. User selects a merit type from the dropdown
2. `handleMeritTypeChange()` is triggered
3. This calls `saveProgressToStorage()`
4. The merit type value is now saved in `formData.meritType`
5. Progress is stored in localStorage

### Restore Process:
1. Page loads and calls `loadSavedProgress()`
2. Event selection is restored, which triggers `populateMeritTypes()`
3. After a 600ms delay (to ensure dropdown is populated), the merit type value is restored
4. `handleMeritTypeChange()` is called to update the UI (show/hide custom fields, etc.)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Merit type selection is saved to localStorage
- [x] Merit type is restored after page refresh
- [x] Custom merit type group shows/hides correctly after restoration
- [x] Next button state is correct after restoration
- [x] All merit type options are available (Committee, Competition, Individual Roles, Custom)
- [x] Works with different event types
- [x] Works when navigating back and forth between steps

## Files Modified
- `/webapp/assets/js/upload-merits.js`
  - `saveProgressToStorage()` - Added meritType to formData
  - `restoreFormData()` - Added merit type restoration with proper timing

## Related Features
This fix ensures that the entire upload process state is preserved across page refreshes, including:
- Selected event and activity
- Merit type selection
- Custom merit values
- Column mappings
- Processed data
- Role assignments

## Benefits
1. **Better User Experience**: Users don't lose their merit type selection when refreshing
2. **Workflow Continuity**: Can pause and resume the upload process without re-configuring
3. **Error Recovery**: If the page crashes or is closed accidentally, progress is preserved
4. **Consistency**: Merit type restoration works the same as other form fields

## Future Improvements
Consider adding:
- Visual indicator showing which fields have been restored from saved progress
- Option to clear specific saved values without clearing all progress
- Progress save timestamp display
- Backup/export of upload configuration
